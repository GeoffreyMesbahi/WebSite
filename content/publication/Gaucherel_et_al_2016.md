abstract = "A meaningful effort for the preservation of endemism would require a deep understanding of its related mechanisms and an accurate estimation of its spatial distribution. Here, we applied methods dedicated to species distribution modelling (SDM) to map an integrated index in India's Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, the endemic tree richness, and to use it for recommendations of protected areas. We then rigorously compared SDM results with spatially explicit and multiscale comparison tools, among them the cutting-edge correlation map and profile (CMP) technique, to finally draw up an endemic richness map with improved accuracy.

The endemic richness showed a sharply increasing southward gradient in the Western Ghats, mainly driven by the seasonality of the temperature and the precipitation's stability. This precise quantification of the tree endemism pattern in peninsular India helped in identifying vulnerable areas in terms of conservation of biodiversity as a whole. The Indian authorities recently used our recommendations to extend protected areas in the southern tip of the Indian peninsula to conserve this endemic richness. We believe that spatial analyses and multiscale comparison tools such as those presented here can help conservationists everywhere to better cope with the difficulties met in identifying zones for protected status.
