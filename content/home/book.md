# [Le compagnon de l’utilisateur R](https://vezy.github.io/compagnon_utilisateur_R/).  
I am the author of the collaborative free open-source book "Le compagnon de l’utilisateur R". This book is a side project that I work on during my free time, so this is still in progress. It is a book about how to use the R progamming language along with RStudio for data science, graphics, reproducible research and more, using state of the art tools such as [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [plotly](https://plot.ly/), [data.table](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/data-table-r-tutorial) etc...  
It is in french only for the moment, but will be translated to other languages hopefully.
